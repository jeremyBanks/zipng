## Considerations

### Shouldn't ZIP and PNG files be compressed?

Do some tests.

Often, but not necessarily always.

## Prior Art / What This Is Not

### Concatenation

You can, with more or less tweaking, take a PNG and concatenate a ZIP on the
end, and get a result that works as both. This is great. (This is what I thought
PICO-8 did until I checked.) However, this (of course) requires that the file
contain the data for both separately, with the resulting consequences.

### Steganography

The PICO-8 fantasy console distributes its game consoles as PNG images of the
game's cover/cartridge design. A game's source code is compressed and
[saved in the lower two bytes of the image data][PICO-8-DECODE]. As long as the
pixels are losslessly preserved, the game data can be extracted, even if it's
been re-encoded or cropped out of a screenshot. This is nice. But the game data
is only intended for use with their custom decoder; it's not stored in a format
that any normal tools can read. The file on-its-own only works as an image.

### Shoving Raw Data in an Image

Okay, we're not too far from this, but still. Patrick Scheibe's Mathematica
